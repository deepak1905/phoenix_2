Thesis project topic: Design and implementation of N-point FFT processor using VHDL for wireless applications

The project hosted on this site consists of two folders:

1. VHDL
2. Docs

The VHDL folder contains the vhdl code implementation done so far. Please note that the work is still in progress.

The Docs folder contains the basic documentation about the FFT processor design details.
