Thesis project topic: Design and implementation of scalable(N-point) FFT processor using VHDL for wireless applications

The project hosted on this site consists of three folders and two files:

1. VHDL
2. Docs
3. synthesis_results
4. Deepak_Revanna_Thesis_Maturity_Test.pdf
5. Deepak_Revanna_Thesis_Presentation.ppt

*. The VHDL folder contains the vhdl code implementation done so far. Please note that the work is still in progress.

*. The Docs folder contains the basic documentation about the FFT processor design details.

*. The synthesis_results folder contains the screen shot of the results after sysnthesizing the design on an 
Altera stratix II FPGA.

*. The thesis maturity test("Deepak_Revanna_Thesis_Maturity_Test.pdf") is a plain text summary on the thesis topic 
presented to supervisor to test the maturity of understanding on the thesis project implemented.

*. The thesis presentation(Deepak_Revanna_Thesis_Presentation.ppt) contains the presentation slides on the thesis
project work presented before the thesis supervisor.
