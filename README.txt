Thesis project topic: Design and implementation of scalable(N-point) FFT processor using VHDL for wireless applications

The project hosted on this site consists of three folders and two files:

1. VHDL
2. Docs
3. synthesis_results
4. Deepak_Revanna_Thesis_Maturity_Test.pdf
5. Deepak_Revanna_Thesis_Presentation.ppt

1. The VHDL folder contains the vhdl code implementation done so far. Please note that the work is still in progress.

2. The Docs folder contains the basic documentation about the FFT processor design details.

3. The synthesis_results folder contains the screen shot of the results after sysnthesizing the design on an 
Altera stratix II FPGA.

4. The thesis maturity test("Deepak_Revanna_Thesis_Maturity_Test.pdf") is a plain text summary on the thesis topic 
presented to supervisor to test the maturity of understanding on the thesis project implemented.

5. The thesis presentation(Deepak_Revanna_Thesis_Presentation.ppt) contains the presentation slides on the thesis
project work presented before the thesis supervisor.

NOTE: The theis project is progressing well and it is now close to completion.
